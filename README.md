# Live-Data-Plotter-for-Arduino-Serial-Data
Takes a serial input from an arduino and plots its data live. Originally meant for a thermal draw tower.

Make sure to run pip install pyserial in terminal. It might not work in pycharm, in that case use visual studio code. The file data.csv is generated for the serial data.
